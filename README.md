# Playwright
The project is a basic end to end flow encompassing below scenarios.


## üßæ Sample Test Scenario:

- Navigate to login page  
- Log in using credentials through a data-driven approach  
- Click on one of the product tabs from **My Account**  
- Select and add a product to cart  
- View the cart  
- Assert cart contents and page title

## üìÅ Project Structure


- **`.github/`**  
  Contains GitHub Actions workflow YAML files.  
  - `workflows/`  
    - `playwright.yml`: Example workflow to run Playwright tests on GitHub Actions.

- **`allure-results/`**  
  Stores Allure test report results (auto-generated after tests).

- **`cucumber-features/`**  
  Contains Gherkin `.feature` files that define test scenarios.  
  - `some-feature.feature`: Example feature file for the login feature.

- **`cucumber-step-definitions/`**  
  Contains step definition files for Gherkin steps (TypeScript functions that implement feature steps).  
  - `loginSteps.ts`: Implementation of login steps for the login feature.

- **`fixtures/`**  
  Base test setup and common fixtures.  
  - `baseTest.ts`: Base test setup file for Playwright (setup/teardown, global hooks).

- **`pages/`**  
  Implements the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for easy interaction with pages.  
  - `LoginPage.ts`: Page object for the login page.

- **`tests/`**  
  Contains test specs that are not Gherkin-based (non-Cucumber tests).  
  - `login.spec.ts`: Test file for login functionality.

- **`testdata/`**  
  Test data in JSON format for data-driven testing.  
  - `userData.json`: Test data for user login.

- **`utils/`**  
  Utility helpers, functions, and constants.  
  - `constants.ts`: Shared constants (URLs, titles, etc.)
  - `dataProvider.ts`: Functions to provide test data.
  - `navigation.ts`: Navigation helpers for page transitions.

- **`playwright-report/`**  
  Playwright's auto-generated HTML reports.

- **`test-results/`**  
  Optional directory for storing consolidated test outputs (e.g., logs, JSON results).

- **`cucumber-report.html`**  
  HTML report generated by the Cucumber CLI after running the tests.

- **`playwright.config.ts`**  
  Configuration file for Playwright (browser settings, base URLs, etc.).

- **`tsconfig.json`**  
  TypeScript configuration file.

- **`.gitignore`**  
  Files and directories to exclude from Git version control (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`).

- **`README.md`**  
  This documentation file, which explains the project setup, structure, and how to run the tests.


## Features

- Modular Page Object Model (POM) design
- Data-driven testing with JSON support
- Reusable helper utilities
- Clean locators and assertions
- Separation of concerns: data, logic, UI interactions


You can now clone, install any dependencies and run the tests.

# Playwright + Cucumber E2E Testing

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style end-to-end testing.

## Project Structure

- `cucumber-features/` ‚Äî Feature files with Gherkin scenarios
- `cucumber-step-definitions/` ‚Äî Step definition files implementing the steps
- `pages/` ‚Äî Page Object Models for UI interactions 
- `utils/` ‚Äî Helper utilities and data providers
- `testdata/` ‚Äî External test data

## Setup

- Install dependencies:  
  Make sure you have `ts-node` and `typescript` installed (already in `devDependencies`).  
   
- Configure `tsconfig.json`:  
  Ensure proper TypeScript support and `"moduleResolution": "node"` is set.

---

## Running Tests:
npx cucumber-js cucumber-features --require cucumber-step-definitions/**/*.ts --require-module ts-node/register 

This command will:

- Load feature files from cucumber-features/
- Load step definitions from cucumber-step-definitions/
- Compile TypeScript on the fly

---

OR  (with tagged test case):

- npx cucumber-js cucumber-features --require cucumber-step-definitions/**/*.ts --require-module ts-node/register --tags @Regression

OR (with html report):

- npx cucumber-js cucumber-features --require cucumber-step-definitions/**/*.ts --require-module ts-node/register --format html:cucumber-report.html

OR (retry for failed test cases):

- npx cucumber-js cucumber-features --require cucumber-step-definitions/**/*.ts --require-module ts-node/register --retry 1

---

## Notes

- Playwright's page object is accessed via Cucumber's this.page in step definitions.
- Test data is loaded from JSON files via a data provider utility.
- Page Objects encapsulate UI actions and assertions.
- Feature files can contain multiple scenarios (test cases).

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure tsconfig.json includes:

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  }
}

- If you get "module not found" errors, verify your folder structure and file names carefully.
