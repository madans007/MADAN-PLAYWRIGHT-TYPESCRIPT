# Playwright
The project is a basic end to end flow encompassing below scenarios.


## üßæ Sample Test Scenario:

- Navigate to login page  
- Log in using credentials through a data-driven approach  
- Click on one of the product tabs from **My Account**  
- Select and add a product to cart  
- View the cart  
- Assert cart contents and page title

## Features

- Modular Page Object Model (POM) design
- Data-driven testing with JSON support
- Reusable helper utilities
- Clean locators and assertions
- Separation of concerns: data, logic, UI interactions


You can now clone, install any dependencies and run the tests.

# Playwright + Cucumber E2E Testing

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style end-to-end testing.

## Project Structure

- `cucumber-features/` ‚Äî Feature files with Gherkin scenarios
- `cucumber-step-definitions/` ‚Äî Step definition files implementing the steps
- `pages/` ‚Äî Page Object Models for UI interactions 
- `utils/` ‚Äî Helper utilities and data providers
- `testdata/` ‚Äî External test data

## Setup

- Install dependencies:  
  Make sure you have `ts-node` and `typescript` installed (already in `devDependencies`).  
   
- Configure `tsconfig.json`:  
  Ensure proper TypeScript support and `"moduleResolution": "node"` is set.

---

## Running Tests:
npx cucumber-js cucumber-features --require cucumber-step-definitions/**/*.ts --require-module ts-node/register 

This command will:

- Load feature files from cucumber-features/
- Load step definitions from cucumber-step-definitions/
- Compile TypeScript on the fly

---

OR  (with tagged test case):

- npx cucumber-js cucumber-features --require cucumber-step-definitions/**/*.ts --require-module ts-node/register --tags @Regression

OR (with html report):

- npx cucumber-js cucumber-features --require cucumber-step-definitions/**/*.ts --require-module ts-node/register --format html:cucumber-report.html

OR (retry for failed test cases):

- npx cucumber-js cucumber-features --require cucumber-step-definitions/**/*.ts --require-module ts-node/register --retry 1

---

## Notes

- Playwright's page object is accessed via Cucumber's this.page in step definitions.
- Test data is loaded from JSON files via a data provider utility.
- Page Objects encapsulate UI actions and assertions.
- Feature files can contain multiple scenarios (test cases).

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure tsconfig.json includes:

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  }
}

- If you get "module not found" errors, verify your folder structure and file names carefully.
